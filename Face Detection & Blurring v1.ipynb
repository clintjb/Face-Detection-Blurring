    "# Face Detection / Blurring\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently read an [article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21280293/anonymize-blur-faces-photos-videos-camera-app-ios) regarding facial recognition algorithms and how they make it easy to identify individuals from a single photo. But with the help of advances in machine learning, itâ€™s also easier than ever to anonymize photos and videos. Based on this, a London AI startup had built an app with a focus on investigative journalists who wanted an easy way to record anonymous footage.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was well aware of OpenCV but never applied/used it myself so thought this could be an intersting little project to see if I could replicate the functionality of the this app directly in Python."
